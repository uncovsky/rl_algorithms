# RL Algorithms & Infrastructure

Personal repository of reinforcement learning implementations, as well as related infrastructure. Some implemented algorithms include:
  - DQN (target net + double q trick)
  - REINFORCE
  - A2C
  - PPO (with GAE and several other implementation tricks)
    
Infrastructure includes torch & logging related utilities as well as a custom replay buffer implementation.
