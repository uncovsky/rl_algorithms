# RL Algorithms & Infrastructure

Personal repository of reinforcement learning implementations, as well as related infrastructure. Some implemented algorithms include:
  - DQN (target net + double q trick)
  - REINFORCE
  - A2C
  - PPO (with GAE and several other implementation tricks)

Offline-RL:
  - Behavior Cloning
  - Advantage Weighted Regression
    
Infrastructure includes torch & logging-related utilities and a custom replay buffer implementation.
